### ‚úÖ Level Scaling System
- Badge-based scaling (`GetNumBadges()`)
- Difficulty modes (Easy/Normal/Hard)
- Wild Pokemon scaling with evolution handling
- Move power limits based on progression
- Level cap enforcement

### üèóÔ∏è Key Architecture
- Level scaling in `src/level_scaling.c`

## Our Battle Facility Design

### üéØ Core Concept: "Battle League Centers"
Replace traditional Pok√©mon Centers with **Battle League Centers** that offer:

1. **Healing Station** (traditional PC functionality)
2. **Battle League Desk** (our main feature)
3. **Team Builder** (rental Pokemon system)
4. **Leaderboards** (ELO display)

### üèüÔ∏è Battle League Mechanics

#### **Format: VGC Doubles**
- Bring 6, pick 4 team preview
- Double battles only
- 15-minute time limit
- Official VGC rules

#### **Difficulty Tiers**
1. **Rookie League** (Lv 25-35) - Early game
2. **Great League** (Lv 40-50) - Mid game  
3. **Ultra League** (Lv 55-65) - Late game
4. **Master League** (Lv 70-80) - Post game
5. **Champion League** (Lv 85-100) - Elite tier

#### **ELO System**
- Start at 1000 ELO
- Win/Loss affects rating (+/- 15-30 points)
- Tier promotion at rating thresholds
- Daily/Weekly leaderboards

### üé≤ Daily Challenge System
Each day, one random modifier:
- **Weather Day**: Permanent weather effect
- **Terrain Day**: Battle terrain active
- **Monotype Day**: Single type teams only
- **Rental Day**: Must use rental Pokemon
- **Inverse Day**: Type effectiveness inverted

### üèÜ Rewards System
- **Battle Points (BP)** for wins
- **League Tokens** for tier advancement
- **Items/TMs** from BP shop
- **Cosmetic rewards** (trainer customization)
- **Pokemon** (rare species, Hidden Abilities)
